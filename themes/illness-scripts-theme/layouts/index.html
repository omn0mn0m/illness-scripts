  <p>This website is just a way for me to organise some thoughts about what I am learning in medical school. Sources are primarily [Merck Manual Professional Version](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional) and [UpToDate](https://www.uptodate.com).</p>

  <p>This is NOT medical advice. I am not a physician. If you are require medical advice, please contact a medical provider like your primary care physician. They probably miss you. :'(</p>
