# Pathophysiology
- Laxation of the pelvic floor ligaments, fascia, and muscles resulting in poor pelvic organ support

## Locations
- Anterior vaginal wall
- Posterior vaginal wall
- Apical/ vaginal vault
- Uterine

# Contextual Factors
- Vaginal childbirth
- Obesity
- Aging
- Pelvic injury
- Chronic straining

# Clinical Manifestation
- Pelvic/ vaginal fullness or pressure
- Feeling of organs falling out
- Organ bulging into vagina or out the opening
  - Introitus: organs bulging out of vaginal opening
- Dysparunia

## By Protruding Organ
- Intestine: lower back pain
- Rectum: Constipation, incomplete defecation - may result in needing to manually press against posterior vaginal wall for relief

## Severity Grading
- Based on the Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification (POP-Q) System

| Stage | Presentation                                                                         |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | No prolapse                                                                          |
| I     | Most distal prolapse is > 1 cm above hymen                                           |
| II    | Most distal prolapse > 1 cm above and < 1 cm below hymen                             |
| III   | Most distal prolapse > 1 cm below hymen and < 2 cm shorter than total vaginal length |
| IV    | Complete eversion                                                                    |

# Complications
- Stress urinary incontinence
- Urinary retention

# Diagnosis
- Clinical exam

## Cystocele, Cystourethrocele
- Single-bladed speculum against posterior vaginal wall
- Prolapse visible on strain bulging from anterior wall
- Should be able to be reduced manually

## Enterocele, Rectocele
- Retracting the anterior vaginal wall
- Prolapse visible on strain and palpable on rectovaginal exam
- Palpable on rectovaginal exam when patient is standing on
