# Pathophysiology
- Immune-mediated demylinating polyneuropathy
- Immune response initated by GI (Campylobacter) or respiratory infection

# Contextual Factors
- Recent infection

# Clinical Manifestation
- Paresthesia, neuropathic pain
- Symmetric, ascending weakness
- Decreased/ absent deep tendon reflexes
- Autonomic dysfunction
- Respiratory compromise

# Complications
- Residual weakness
- Chronic inflammatory demylinating polyneuropathy

# Diagnosis
- Clinical
- Supportive findings
  - CSF: increased protein, normal leukocytes
  - Abnormal EMG and nerve conduction studies
  - MRI: normal or anterior nerve root/ cauda equina enhancement

# Treatment
- Autonomic and respiratory function monitoring
- IV immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis
