# Pathophysiology
- Cystic dilation of biliary tree

| Type | Characterisation                                                                            | Occurence (%) |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| I    | Fusiform dilation of extrahepatic common bile duct                                          | 80 - 90       |
| II   | Saccular outpouchings (diverticula) from supraduodenal extrahepatic/ intrahepatic bile duct | 3             |
| III  | Protrusion of focally dilated, intramural segment of distal common bile duct into duodenum  | 5             |
| IV   | Multiple communicating intra- and extrahepatic duct cysts                                   | 10            |
| V    | Cystic dilations of intrahepatic bile ducts - associated with renal cystic disease          | Rare              |

# Contextual Factors
- Uncommon in western countries
- Not as rare in East Asian countries

# Clinical Manifestation
- Triad:
  - Abdominal pain
  - RUQ mass
  - Jaundice
- W/ or w/o nausea, vomiting

## Neonates
- Jaundice 
- Acholic stools
- Dark urine
- Hepatomegaly

## Complications
- Cholangiocarcinoma
- Acute cholangitis
- Pancreatitis
- Stone formation

# Diagnosis
- Ultrasound
- CT scan
- MR chalngiopancreatography

# Treatment
- Cyst resection to decrease risk of malignancy
- W/ or w/o roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy to allow for biliary drainage
