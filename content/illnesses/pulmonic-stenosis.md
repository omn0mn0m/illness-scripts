Pulmonic stenosis is a valvulopathy due to the pulmonic valve obstructing blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, presenting with similar symptoms to aortic stenosis. It is diagnosed with echocardiography and treated with balloon valvuloplasty if disease is severe.

# Pathophysiology
- Often congenital
  - Seen in tetralogy of Fallot
- Can also be due to carcinoid syndrome in adults

# Contextual Factors
- Tetralogy of Fallot

# Clinical Manifestation
- Asymptomatic in most cases
- Can have aortic stenosis symptoms:
  - Syncope
  - Angina
  - Dyspnea

## Cardiac
### Auscultation
- Widened S2 splitting due to delayed P2
- Harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur
  - Dose not radiate to the carotid arteries

# Complications
- Right heart failure

# Diagnosis
- Echocardiography

| Severity | Peak Gradient (mmHg) | Peak Velocity (m/s) |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Mild     | < 36                 | < 3                 |
| Moderate | 36 - 64              | 3 - 4               |
| Severity | > 64                 | > 4                 |

- ECG: RV hypertrophy or right bundle branch block

# Treatment
- Most cases will improve without intervention
- Balloon valvuloplasty can be done for moderate or severe stenosis
