Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease most commonly affecting the ileum and the colon, presenting with diarrhea, abdominal, abscesses, fistulas, and bowel obstruction. It is diagnosed with colonoscopy and imaging and is treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid, corticosteroids, immunosuppresants, and antibiotics. Surgery may be necessary but is not currative.

# Pathophysiology
- Crypt inflammation and abscesses -> focal aphthoid ulcers -> deep longitudinal/ transverse ulcers
- Transmurral inflammation -> lymphedema and bowel wall/ mesentery thickening -> muscularis mucosae hypertrophy, fibrosis, stricture -> bowel obstruction
- "Cobblestoned appearance"

# Contextual Factors
- Family history of Crohn's disease
- Stunted childhood growth

# Clinical Manifestation
## General
- Fever
- Anorexia
- Weight loss

## Abdominal
- Chronic diarrhea
- Abdominal pain
  - Ileitis can mimic acute appendicitis or bowel obstruction
- Perianal disease: abscesses and fistulas
  - Often **NO** gross rectal bleeding
  
## Musculoskeletal
- Arthritis

## Dermatologic
- Erythema nodosum

## Skip Areas
- Diseased bowel "skips" with areas of healthy bowel in between

| Area          | Inflammation          | % of Patients Affected | Notable Features                    |
|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Ileum         | Ileitis               | 30                     |                                     |
| Ileum + Colon | Ileocolitis           | 40                     | Predilation of right colon          |
| Colon         | Granulomatous colitis | 30                     | Spares the rectum                   |
| Small bowel   | Jejunoileitis         | Very rare              | Can be due to surgical intervention |

# Complications
- Bowel obstruction
- Fistula
- Abscess
- Cancer in affected areas
- Chronic malabsorption leading to vitamin D and B12 deficiency
- Toxic colitis - requires aggressive surgical intervention

# Diagnosis
## Labs
- Screening for:
  - Anemia
  - Hypoalbuminemia
  - Electrolyte abnormalities
- Liver function tests
  - Elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT suggest primary sclerosing cholangitis secondary to colonic involvement
- Acute phase inflammatory markers for trending disease progression: ESR, CRP
- Bone density (DEXA scan)
- Antibodies specific to Crohn's (not commonly measured for diagnosis)
  - Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies
  - Anti-OmpC
  - Anti-CBir1

## Imaging
- Acute presentation: abdominal CT
  - Can also use CT or MT enterography with ingested contrast: looking for strictures or fistulas
- Not acute presentation: Small bowel follow-through (x-ray series with ingested barium contrast)
- Less often: 
  - Upper endoscopy: suspicion for gastroduodenal involvement
  - Colonoscopy: to differentiate between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
  - Barium enema: for primarily colonic presentation)
  - Video capsule endoscopy: questionable findings in other modalities

## Classification
- Primarily inflammatory
- Primarily stenotic/ obstructing
- Primarily penetrating/ fistulising

# Treatment
## Acute Flare-Up
- High-dose corticosteroids

## Lifestyle
- Smoking cessation
- Immunisations
- Regular cancer screenings

## Reducing Inflammatory Response
- 5-aminosalicylic acid: blocks prostaglandin and leukotriene production, reducing inflammatory response
- Immunomodulating medications
  - Azathioprine
  - 6-mercaptopurine
  - Methotrexate
- Biologic agents: all the -mabs

## Supportive
- Loperamide, except during severe Crohn's colitis which may result in toxic colitis
- Antispasmodics

## Fistulas
- Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin
- If not responding after 3-4 weeks: immunomodulator with or without biologic

## Surgery
- Done for recurrent intestinal obstruction or intractable fistulas/ abscesses
- Not curative
