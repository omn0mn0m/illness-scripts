Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease affecting the colonic mucosa, presenting with bloody diarrhea, arthritis, and mild abdominal cramps. It is diagnosed with colonoscopy and treated with immunosuppresants and surgery.

# Pathophysiology
- Inflammation of the colonic mucosa and submucosa -> erythematous, granular, and friable membrane
  - Originates in the rectium and extends proximally
  - Loss of vascular pattern and scattered hemorrhaging
  - Severe stages: large mucosal ulcers with purulent exudate
- Sharp border between diseased area and normal area

# Contextual Factors
- Family history of ulcerative colitis

# Clinical Manifestation
## General
- Fever
- Anemia
- Anorexia
- Weight loss

## Abdominal
- Episodes of bloody diarrhea
- Fecal urgency4
- Lower abdominal cramps
- Blood/ mucus in the stool

# Complications
- Colon cancer

## Toxic Colitis/ Fulminant Colitis
1. Stop antidiarrheals
2. NPO and NG placed to suction for decompression
3. Aggressive IV fluid and electrolytes
4. Inflammatory response suppression
  - High-dose IV corticosteroids or cyclosporine
  - Infliximab
5. Antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin)
6. Surgery if poor improvement after 48 hours

# Diagnosis
## Labs
- Rule out infectious causes (C. diff): stool cultures
- Screening for:
  - Anemia
  - Hypoalbuminemia
  - Elecrolyte abnormalities
- Liver enzyme tests:
  - Elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT suggest possible primaryu sclerosing cholangitis
- Antibodies specific to ulcerative colitis:
  - Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies

## Imaging
- Sigmoidoscopy with biopsy
- Abdominal x-ray can show some abnormalities, but is not a great diagnostic indicator
  - Shortened, rigid colon with atrophic/ pseudopolypoid mucosa
  - Intestinal ischemia or Crohn's colitis: thumbprinting and segmental distribution

# Treatment
- Very similar treatment to Crohn's disease

## Acute Flare-Up
- High-dose corticosteroids

## Lifestyle
- Dietary management: limiting raw fruits and vegetables, milk
- Immunisations
- Regular cancer screenings
- Smoking is protective but has many risks that outweigh the benefits

## Mild Disease
- 5-aminosalicylic acid: blocks prostaglandin and leukotriene production, reducing inflammatory response
- Initially high dose given then tapered once stable

## Moderate/ Extensive Disease
- Immunomodulating medications
  - Azathioprine
  - 6-mercaptopurine
- Biologic agents: all the -mabs

## Severe Disease
- Trial of biologic agents with or without corticosteroids for 3-7 days
- IV cyclosporine if poor response, then oral cyclosporine for 3-4 months if responsive
  - Alternatively can use tacrolimus
  
### Surgery
- Done for unresponsive severe disease
- Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA)
- Curative due to localisation of ulcerative colitis

## Supportive
- Loperamide, except during severe flare-up which may result in toxic colitis
