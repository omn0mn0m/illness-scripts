Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition due to mutations relating to chromosome 21 resulting in intellectual disability and physical abnormalities. It is diagnosed by genetic testing and treated based on manifestations.

<!--more-->
# Pathophysiology
## Possible Gene Mutations
- Translocation of chromosome 21 to chromosome 14 t(14;21)
- Translocation t(21;22)

# Contextual Factors
- 6000 babies/ years
- Previous children with Down syndrome
- Parent with Down syndrome
- Pregnant mother > 34 years old

# Clinical Manifestation
## Pediatric/ At Birth
### Cardiac
- Ventricular septal defect
- Atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion)

### Endocrine
- Hypothyroidism
- Diabetes

### GI
- Duodenal atresia or stenosis
- Hirschsprung disease
- Celiac disease

### HEENT
- Ophthalmic disorders: congenital cataracts, glaucoma, strabismus, refractive errors
- Hearing loss
- Anomalous ears
- Recurrent otitis media
- Flat facial profile
- Excessive skin at nape of the neck
- Slanted palpebral fissures

### Heme/Onc
- Thrombocytopenia
- Neonatal polycythemia
- Transient myelodysplastic disorder
- Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
- Acute lymphocytic leukemia

### MSK
- Hyperflexibility of joints
- Dysplasia of pelvis
- Dysplasia of mid-phalanx of fifth finger
- Transverse palmar (Simian) crease

### Neuro
- Hypotonia
- Poor Moro reflex
- Cognitive impairement
  - Mild (IQ 50 - 75)
  - Severe (IQ 20 - 35)
- Gross motor and language delays
- Autistic behaviour

### Respiratory
- Obstructive sleep apnea

## Adult
- Reduced height
- Risk of obesity

### Cardiac
- Mitral valve prolapse
- Aortic regurgitation

### Neuro
- Early-onset Alzheimer's

# Diagnosis
## Prenatal Detection
- Fetal ultrasonography
- Maternal serum screening
- Noninvasive prenatal screening

## Prenatal Diagnosis
- Prenatal chorionic villus sampling
- Amniocentesis w/ karyotyping

## Neonatal Diagnosis
- Postnatal karyotyping

# Treatment
- No cure
- Genetic counseling for the family

## Symptom Treatment
- Cardiac: surgical repair
- Hypothyroidism: thyroid hormone replacement

## Support
- Social support
- Educational accomodations

## Screenings
- Down syndrome growth chart
- Atlantoaxial instability screening (if suspicious)
- Celiac disease screening (if suspicious)
