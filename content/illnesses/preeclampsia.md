Preeclampsia is a gestational complication presenting as hypertension and organ damage. It is diagnosed with blood pressure monitoring and labs. It is ultimately treated with delivery.

# Pathophysiology
- Poorly understood
- Poorly developed uterine placental spiral arterioles
  - Leads to decreased uteroplacental blood flow during pregnancy
- Lipid peroxidation of cell membranes induced by free radicals

# Contextual Factors
## High Risk
- History of preeclampsia
- Multifetal gestation
- Kidney disorders
- Autoimmune disorders
- Diabetes mellitus
- Chronic hypertension before pregnancy

## Moderate Risk
- First pregnancy
- Maternal age >= 30
- BMI > 30
- Family history of preeclampsia
- Socioeconomic hardship

# Clinical Manifestation
- Edema
  - Facial or hand swelling
- Excessive weight gain
- Petechiae

## Severe Features
- Severe headache
- Visual disturbances
- Confusion
- Hyperreflexia
- Epigastric or right upper quadrant abdominal pain
- Nausea and vomiting
- Dyspnea
- Oliguria
- Stroke

## Eclampsia
- Tonic-clonic generalised seizures

# Complications
- Fetal growth restriction
- Fetal death
- Maternal ischemia resulting in multiple organ failure
  - Brain
  - Kidneys
  - Liver
 - Placental abruption
 - HELLP syndrome

# Diagnosis
- Must meet two criteria:
  1. New-onset hypertension that starts after 20 weeks gestation
  2. Proteinuria and/ or end-organ damage
  
## Blood Pressure
- Systolic BP >= 140 mmHg and/ or diastolic BP >= 90 mmHg occuring twice 4 hours apart
- Systolic BP >= 160 mmHg and/ or diastolic BP >= 110 mmHg occuring once
  - Considered preeclampsia w/ severe features if occurs twice 4 hours apart

## Proteinuria
- > 300 mg/ 24 hours or protein/ creatinine ratio >= 0.3
- If no other tests available: dipstick 2+

## Preeclampsia Labs After Diagnosis
- CBC
- Platelet count
- Uric acid
- Liver tests
- BUN
- Creatinine
- Fetal nonstress test

## Signs of End-Organ Damage (Severe Features)
- Thombocytopenia: platelets < 100000/mcL
- Renal insufficiency: serum creatinine > 1.1 mg/dL
  - Patients without renal disease: serum creatinine 2x baseline
- Impaired liver function: aminotransferases (ALT or AST) > 2x normal
- Symptoms of liver capsule distension: right upper quadrant pain, epigastric pain
- Pulmonary edema
- Central nervous system dysfunction: Visual symptoms, new-onset headache with no relief from acetaminophen, altered mental status

# Treatment
- Antihypertensive treatment
- Delivery, if safe or necessary
- Magnesium sulfate as seizure prophylaxis

## Antihypertensives
- No hospitalisation needed if maternal and fetal status are fine
  - Outpatient visits with maternal-fetal medicine once a week
- Labetalol is preferred
- Plan for induction at 37 weeks

## Delivery
### Factors to Consider
- Gestational age
- Fetal growth restriction
- Fetal distress
- Severity of preeclampsia
- Response to antihypertensives

### Indications for Delivery
- Gestational age >= 37 weeks
  - Gestational age >= 34 weeks if severe features present
- HELLP syndrome
- Concerns on fetal monitoring
- Eclampsia 

### Meds to Give with Delivery
- Corticosteroids for 48 hours if gestational age < 34 weeks
  - Accelerates fetal lung maturity
  - Sometimes indicated at gestational age < 36 weeks

## Magnesium Sulfate
- Initial 4 g IV over 20 minutes
- Subsequent constant 2 g/hour infusion
- Decrease if magnesium level > 10 mEq/L or hyporeflexia starts
- Continue 24 hours after delivery

## Postpartum Care
- 1-2 week follow-ups for BP checks
- Diagnosis of chronic hypertension if persistently hypertensive postpartum
