Endometriosis is the implantation of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus, resulting in dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility (along with location-specific symptoms). Diagnosis is through direct visualisation and treatment is ovarian suppression and surgery.

# Pathophysiology
- Retrograde flow of menstrual tissue through the fallopian tube
- Endometrial cells implant ectopically

# Contextual Factors
- 1st degree relatives with endometriosis
- Delayed childbearing or nulliparity
- Early menarche
- Late menopause
- Shortened menstrual cycles with heavy/ prolonged menses

## Protective Factors
- Multiple births
- Prolonged lactation
- Late menarche
- Early menopause
- Long-term use of oral contraceptive pills

# Clinical Manifestation
## Classic Triad
- Dysmenorrhea: pain durring menses
- Dyspareunia: pain during intercourse
- Infertility

## Location-Specific Symptoms
- Variable based on ectopic implant site

| Site                   | Symptoms                                                                          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ovaries                | Endometrioma (2 - 10 cm cyst), abdominal pain, peritoneal signs                   |
| Adnexal structures     | Adnexal adhesions, pelvic mass, pelvic pain                                       |
| Bladder                | Dysuria, hematuria, suprapubic/ pelvic pain, urinary frequency, urge incontinence |
| Colon                  | Defecation pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, rectal bleeding during menses  |
| Extrapelvic structures | Vague abdominal pain                                                              |

# Diagnosis
- Direct visualisation: pelvic laparoscopy, laparotomy, vaginal exam, sigmoidoscopy, cystoscopy
- Biopsy - not required but confirms diagnosis
- Up and coming: T1 and T2-weighted MRI

## Staging
| Stage | Classification | Description                                                                         |
|-------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I     | Minimal        | Superficial implants                                                                |
| II    | Mild           | Deeper implants                                                                     |
| III   | Moderate       | Deep implants, small endometriomas, filmy adhesions                                 |
| IV    | Severe         | Many deep implants, large endometriomas, dense adhesions, rectal adhesion to uterus |

# Treatment
## Pharmacotherapy
- First line: Estrogen-progestin contraceptives
- Others: progestin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists, danazol

## Surgical
- Surgical resection or ablation of endometriotic tissue
- Total abdominal hysterectomy w/ or w/o bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

## Supportive
- NSAIDs for pain
