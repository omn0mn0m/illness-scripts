# Pathophysiology
- Aspirin use in children during viral infection
- Mitochondrial dysfunction -> impaired fatty acid metabolism -> microvesicular fat deposits in liver
- Hepatic dysfunction -> ammonia accumulation -> cerebral astrocyte edema

# Contextual Factors
- Prior viral infection

# Clinical Manifestation
- Acute liver failure: hepatomegaly w/o jaundice
- Rapidly progressive encephalopathy: vomiting, lethargy, seizure, coma
- NO jaundice

# Complications
- Seizure
- Coma
- Death

# Diagnosis
## Lab Findings
| Lab       | Trend    | Reason                                  |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| AST       | Increase | Release from damaged cells              |
| ALT       | Increase | Release from damaged cells              |
| Ammonia   | Increase | Impaired ammonia metabolism             |
| Bilirubin | Normal   |                                         |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| PT        | Increase | Decreased coagulation factor production |
| INR       | Increase | Decreased coagulation factor production |
| PTT       | Increase | Decreased coagulation factor production |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Glucose   | Decrease | Decreased gluconeogenesis               |

- Metabolic acidosis

# Treatment
- Supportive
