Asthma is a respiratory illness characterised by airway inflammation due to a triggering stimuli. Symptoms include dyspnea, cough, wheezing. Diagnosis is clinical with pulmonary function tests. Treatment is beta-2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids.

# Pathophysiology
- Bronchoconstriction
- Airway edema and inflammation
- Airway hyperreactivity
  - Loss of bronchoconstriction inhibitors (prostaglandin E2)
  - Loss of endogenous bronchoconstrictor metabolisers (endopeptidases)
- Airway remodeling: desquamation, subepithelial fibrosis, angiogenesis, smooth muscle hypertrophy
  - Due to TH2 cells, eosinophils, and mast cells forming an inflammatory infiltrate in the epithelium/ smooth muscle

## Wheezing
- Bronchospasm worsened by inflammation of small/ medium airways
- Inflammation causes edema and airway narrowing
- Narrow airway causes high velocity/ turbulent air flow

# Contextual Factors
- Recurrent wheezing episodes
  - Can continue into adulthood or stop by 6-10 years old
- Previous viral illness (respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus)
- Atopic symptoms
- Family history of atopy or asthma

## Environmental Factors
- Allergen exposure
- Diet
- Perinatal factors

# Clinical Manifestation
- Often asymptomatic between exacerbations
- Soft wheezes during forced expiration or after exercise
- Uncontrolled asthma: barrel-shaped thorax from frequent lung hyperinflation

# Diagnosis
- Clinical evaluation
- Pulmonary Function Testing

# Treatment
- Control of triggers
- Monitoring
- Patient education
- Treatment of acute exacerbations

## Drug Therapy
- Only needed if high risk of severe/ frequent wheezing episodes
- Inhaled corticosteroids
- Leukotriene modifier
