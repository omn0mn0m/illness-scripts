# Pathophysiology
- FMR1 gene mutation - unstable triple repeat expansion
- X-linked dominant

# Contextual Factors
- Most common inherited cause of intellectual disability
- More commonly affects males

# Clinical Manifestation
## Physical
- Large, protuberant ears
- Prominent chin
- Prominent forehead
- High-arched palate

- Hyperextensible joints
- Mitral valve prolapse

## Cognitive
- Mild to moderate intellectual disability
- Autistic features

## Premutation Features
- Premature ovarian failure - mid-30s menopause
- Fragile X-associated tremour/ ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)
  - Gait abnormalities
  - Intention tremours
  - Later intellectual impairment

# Complications
- Connective tissue disorders

# Diagnosis
- DNA testing
  - CGG repeats

# Treatment
- Supportive care
- Early intervention for autism symptoms
