Mitral stenosis is a valvulopathy due to the mitral valve obstructing blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle, presenting with heart failure symptoms and pulmonary hypertension. It is diagnosed with echocardiography and treated with diuretics, beta-blockers, anticoagulants, comissurotomy, or valve replacement.
