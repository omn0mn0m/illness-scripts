Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is a skeletal injury due to weakening of the femoral physis. It is diagnosed with x-ray and treated with screw fixation.

# Pathophysiology
- Weakening of the femoral physis (growth plate)
- Allows for anterior displacement of the proximal femoral diaphsis with femoral head posterior slippage

# Contextual Factors
- Obesity
- Adolescent age

# Clinical Manifestation
- Dull hip pain
- Limited hip internal rotation
- Referred knee pain
- Abnormal gait
  - Antalgic gait (unilateral SCFE)
  - Waddling gait (bilateral SCFE)

# Complications
- Avascular necrosis
- Osteoarthritis

# Diagnosis
- X-ray
  - Posteriorly displaced femoral head

# Treatment
- Non-weight bearing
- Surgical screw fixation for physis stabilisation
