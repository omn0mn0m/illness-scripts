# Pathophysiology
- Pulmonary artery gets occluded by something that traveled from outside the lung
- Can be occluded by thrombus, air embolus, amniotic fluid, fat, foreign body, etc.
- Occlusion causes right ventricular pressure to increase, leading to right ventricular failure

# Contextual Factors
- Deep vein thrombosis
- Age > 60 years
- Hormonal modulation, such as combined oral contraceptives
- Heart failure
- Reduced mobility/ immobilisation
- Infection
- Nephrotic syndrome
- Obesity
- Pregnancy
- History of PE
- Smoking
- Thrombotic disorders

# Clinical Manifestation
- Acute dyspnea
- Pleuritic chest pain
- Cough
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea

# Complications
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Right ventricular failure
- Shock
- Death

# Diagnosis
- High index of suspicion
- Pre-test probability
- D-dimer testing
- CT angiography
- Ventilation/ perfusion scanning
- Duplex ultrasonography

## Pre-Test Probability
- Consider probability of PE before diagnostic testing

### Wells Score System
| Symptom                                               | Points |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Symptoms of DVT                                       | 3      |
| No better alternative diagnosis                       | 3      |
| Tachycardia w/ pulse > 100                            | 1.5    |
| Immobilisation (>= 3 days) or surgery in past 4 weeks | 1.5    |
| Prior history of DVT or PE                            | 1.5    |
| Presence of hemoptysis                                | 1      |
| Presence of malignancy                                | 1      |

| Score | Interpretation       |
|-------|----------------------|
| > 6   | High probability     |
| 2 - 6 | Moderate probability |
| < 2   | Low probability      |

### Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC)
- Meeting all 8 criteria helps decrease suspicion:
  - Age < 50 years
  - Heart rate < 100
  - Oxygen saturation >= 95%
  - No prior DVT or PE
  - No unilateral leg swelling
  - No estrogen use
  - No hemoptysis
  - No surgery or trauma requiring hospitalisation within the past 4 weeks

# Treatment
- Supportive therapy
- Anticoagulation
- Inferior vena cava filter placement (rarely used)
- Rapid clot burden reduction
  - Thrombolysis
  - Embolectomy
