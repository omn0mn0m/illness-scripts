# Pathophysiology
- Anovulation or ovulatory dysfunction
- Increase in androgen likely due to cytochrome P450c17 affecting rate-limiting enzyme in androgen production
- Exacty etiology unclear

# Contextual Factors
- Family history
- Obesity
- Insulin resistance
- Fetal androgen exposure

# Clinical Manifestation
- Irregular menses
- Hirsutism
- Acnes
- Hair thinning
- Acanthosis nigricans: thick, darkened skin
  - Due to insulin resistance resulting in high insulin levels

# Complications
- Infertility
- Endometrial hyperplasia/ endometrial cancer
- Metabolic syndrome

# Diagnosis
- Clinical criteria (2+/3)
  - Ovulatory dysfunction presenting as irregular menses
  - Hyperandrogenism
  - > 10 follicles/ ovary vis pelvic ultrasound
  
## Supporting Tests
- Pregnancy test
- FSH
- Prolactin
- TSH
- Serum free testosterone
- Serum cortisol (rules out Cushing syndrome)

# Treatment
- Combined estrogen/ progestin oral contraceptives (COC)
- Progestin-only contraceptive (if unable to take COC)
