Heart failure is a dysfunction of either the right or left ventricle, which is diagnosed clinically and supported with imaging and plasma natriuretic peptide levels. It is treated with goal-directed medical therapy (GDMT).

# Pathophysiology
- Heart is unable to provide adequate perfusion to meet metabolic needs
- Pulmonary and/or venous pressure increases, causing organ congestion

## Left Ventricle Failure
- Cardiac output decreases
- Pulmonary venous pressure increases
  - Pulmonary capillary pressure > oncotic pressure = fluid extravasation into interstitial space/ alveoli (pulmonary edema)
  - Reduces pulmonary compliance
  - Increases work of breathing
- Pulmonary edema decreases systemic arterial oxygenation (PaO2) -> dyspnea

### Severe Left Ventricle Failure
- Pleural effusion -> even worse dyspnea
- Minute ventilation increases -> PaCO2 decreases, blood pH increases (respiratory alkalosis)
- Interstitial edema of small airways eventually elevates PaCO2, indicating inability to compensate -> respiratory failure

## Right Ventricle Failure
- Systemic venous pressure increases -> fluid extravasation and edema
  - Particularly affects feet and ankles, abdominal visceera
  - Liver mostly affected: moderate hepatic dysfunction
    - Increased conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, PT, and hepatic enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase)
    - Inability to break down aldosterone causes more fluid accumulation
  - Stomach and intestine can become congested
    - Anorexia
    - Malabsorption
    - Protein losing enteropathy (diarrhea, marked hypoalbuminemia)
    - Chronic GI blood loss
    - Ischemic bowel infarction
  - Ascites: fluid in peritoneal cavity

## Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)
- Left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to:
  - Poor contraction
    - Decreased ejection fraction
  - Inadequate emptying
    - Increased diastolic volume and pressure
    - Increased diastolic volume and pressure from LV failure can lead to RV failure
    
### Compensatory Responses
#### Cardiovascular
- Ventricular remodeling: both ventricles dilate and hypertrophy
  - LV also changes from ovoid to spherical
  - Dilation can cause mitral or tricuspid valve regurgitation due to annular dilation -> increases end-diastolic volume
- Increases diastolic stiffness and wall tension -> diastolic dysfunction
  - Compromised cardiac performance, exacerbated by physical stress
  - Increased oxygen demand and myocardial cell apoptosis
- Increased O2 extraction from blood by shifting oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the right
- Arterial baroreflex activation -> increased sympathetic tone, decreased parasympathetic tone
  - Increased HR and myocardial contractility
  - Arteriole and venous constriction
  - Sodium and water retention
  
#### Renal
- Activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in response to decreased renal perfusion
  - Increases sodium and water retention
  - Increases renal and peripheral vascular tone
  - Works in tandem with arterial baroreflex activation
- Increased angiotensin II causes a few problems:
  - Vasoconstriction including efferent renal vasoconstriction (increases end-diastolic volume)
  - Increases aldosterone production -> myocardial and vascular collagen deposition/ fibrosis
    - Contributes to aldosterone that is already produced by the heart
  - Increases norepinephrine release -> stimulates vasopressin release and apoptosis
  - Contributes to heart remodeling
  
### Neurohumoral
- Goal is to increase heart function, maintain blood pressure, and maintain organ perfusion
- Beta-1 receptor downregulation as response to intense sympathetic activation
  - Impaired myocyte contractility -> decreases oxygen demand
  - Increased heart rate -> increases cardiac output
- Vasopressin release in response to blood pressure decrease
  - Decreases renal excretion of free water -> hyponatremia
- Atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) release in response to ventricular stretching
  - Increases renal sodium excretion
    - Not as effective due to decreased renal perfusion pressure
- TNF alpha release -> catabolism and cardiac cachexia
- Increased free fatty acid utilisation and decreased glucose utilisation

## Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
- Impaired LV filling resulting in increased LV end-diastolic pressure
  - Pressure backs up into the left atrium, causing pulmonary hypertension and congestion
- Normal LV end-diastolic volume
- Normal contractility means that a normal percent of the filled ventricle is ejected

# Contextual Factors
- Increased cardiac output demand: anemia, hyperthyroidism, Paget disease
- Arrhythmia
- Conduct defects: AV node block, left bundle branch block
- Infiltrative or matrix disorders: amyloidosis, chronic fibrosis, hemochromatosis

## Systolic Dysfunction
- Myocardial infarction
- Myocarditis
- Dilated cardiomyopathy

## Diastolic Dysfunction
- Impaired ventricular relaxation
  - Ventricular hypertrophy
- Increased ventricular stiffness
  - Old age
  - Obesity
  - Hypertension
  - Diabetes
  - Chronic kidney disease
- Valvular disease
  - Aortic stenosis
  - Mitral regurgitation
  - Tricuspid regurgitation
- Constrictive pericarditis
- Acute myocardial ischemia
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

# Clinical Manifestation
- Fatigue
- Cool peripheries
- Postrual lightheadedness
- Nocturia
- Decreased daytime micturition

## LV Failure
- Dyspnea, sometimes with nocturnal cough
  - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND): dyspnea that awakens patient after several hours, requiring sitting up for relief
  - Sleep apnea
- Cheyne-Stokes respiration: periodic/ cyclic breathing consisting of apnea -> faster and deeper breathing -> slower and shallower breathing
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea
- Cyanosis (lips, fingers, toes)

## RV Failure
- Ankle swelling
- Abdominal/ neck fullness
- RUQ discomfort
- Early satiety, anorexia, abdominal bloating

## Geriatric Atypical Presentations
- Confusion
- Delirium
- Falls
- Sudden functional decline

## Cardiac Exam
- Pansystolic murmur from mitral regurgitation at apex

### HFrEF
- Diffuse, sustained, laterally displaced apical impulse
- Audible S3, S4 heart sounds
- Accentuated pulmonic component of S2

### RV Failure
- Jugular venous pressure elevation with a or v waves
- Lower extremity nontender peripheral pitting edema

## Pulmonary Exam
- Early inspiratory basilar crackles that do not clear with coughing
- Signs of pleural effusion: dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds at lung bases

## Abdominal Exam
- Abdominal swelling and ascites
- Enlarged/ pulsatile liver palpable below the right costal margin
