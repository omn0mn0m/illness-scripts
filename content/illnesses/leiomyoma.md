Leiomyomas are uterine fibroids that appear on the uterus, causing pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and urinary issues. They are screened for on bimanual pelvic exam and confirmed with ultrasound or MRI, then treated with NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, or surgery.

# Pathophysiology
- Smooth muscle tumours arising from the myometrium
- Develops monoclonally from one smooth muscle cell
- Enlarges with estrogen

## FIGO Classification (PALM-COEIN) for Causes of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Subclassification
- L = leiomyoma
- Subclassification based on location relative to uterine tissue layers

### Submucosal
- At surface of the uterus

| Type | Criteria                   |
|------|----------------------------|
| 0    | Pedunculated intracavitary |
| 1    | < 50% intramural           |
| 2    | >= 50% intramural          |

### Intramural
- Within the uterine wall

| Type | Criteria                              |
|------|---------------------------------------|
| 3    | Contacts endometrium, 100% intramural |
| 4    | Intramural                            |

### Other
- Subserous: at surface of uterus
- Other: cervix, broad ligament, fallopian tube, etc.

| Type | Criteria                    |
|------|-----------------------------|
| 5    | Subserous >= 50% intramural |
| 6    | Subserous < 50% intramural  |
| 7    | Subserous pedunculated      |
| 8    | Other                       |

## Shape Definitions
- Pedunculated: growing on a stalk
- Sessile: broad base without protrusion

# Contextual Factors
## Non-Modifiable
- Reproductive age
- Black race
- Early menarche
- Genetic predisposition: MED12, HMGA1, HMGA2 mutations

## Modifiable
- Obesity
- Hypertension
- Consumption of red meats
- Low number of births (< 3)
  - Technically it's modified by having more babies, but don't actually tell patients to have more than 3 babies to decrease the risk of fibroids...

# Clinical Manifestation
- Can be asymptomatic
- Abnormal uterine bleeding
- Pelvic pain or pressure
- Urinary frequency or urgency
- Constipation

# Diagnosis
## Screening
- Bimanual pelvic exam
  - Enlarged, irregular, mobile uterus
  - Adnexal mass
  - Tenderness

## Imaging
- Ultrasonography
- Saline infusion sonography if abnormal uterine bleeding is present
  - Visualises submucosal fibroids
- MRI

## Procedures
- Hyesteroscopy

# Treatment
## Bleeding Control
- NSAIDs
- Tranexamic acid
- Estrogen-progestin contraceptives
- Progestins

## Removal
- Myomectomy: removal of just fibroids to preserve uterine function
  - Increases risk of uterine rupture during labour - cessarian section delivery required
  - Has chance of recurrence
- Hysterectomy: complete removal of uterus
