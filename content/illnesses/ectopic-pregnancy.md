Ectopic pregnancy occurs when an egg implants outside of the uterus, presenting as pelvic pain and bleeding. It is diagnosed with beta-hCG level and pelvic ultrasound. It is treated with methotrexate or surgery.

# Pathophysiology
- Egg implantation outside of the uterus
- Non-viable pregnancy

## Locations
| Location  | Probability (%) |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Ampullary | 80              |
| Isthmus   | 12              |
| Fimbria   | 5               |
| Abdomen   | 1.4             |
| Ovary     | < 3             |
| Cervix    | < 1             |

# Contextual Factors
- Prior ectopic pregnancy
- Prior abdominal or pelvic surgery (due to scar tissue)
- Tubal abnormalities
- IUD use
- History of chlamydia
- Infertility
- Cigarette smoking
- Prior abortion

# Clinical Manifestation
- Can be asymptomatic until rupture
- Pelvic pain
- Vaginal bleeding

## Pelvic Exam
- Cervical motion tenderness
- Adnexal tenderness
- Adnexal mass

# Complications
- Ectopic pregnancy rupture
  - Sudden evere pain
  - Hemorrhagic shock
  - Peritonitis

# Diagnosis
- Urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG)
- Quantitative serum beta-hCG
  - Discriminatory zone: 2000 mlU/mL - indicates (possibly ectopic) pregnancy
  - Might have to repeat every 2 days outpatient if not confirmed as ectopic
- Pelvic ultrasonography to confirm no intrauterine pregnancy

# Treatment
- Methotrexate if criteria met
- Surgical resection if methotrexate criteria not met or ectopic rupture
- Rho(D) immune globulin if patient is Rh-negative

## Methotrexate Criteria (Must meet all)
- Hemodynamically stable with no current/ impending rupture
- CBC, renal, and liver function tests normal
- Pregnancy < 3-4 cm
- No fetal heart activity
- beta-hCG <= 5000 mlU/mL
- Patient will comply with post-treatment follow-up
